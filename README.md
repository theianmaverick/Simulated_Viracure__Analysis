# A Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind Trial of Viracure™ for Treatment of Morava Respiratory Virus (MRV) 

*Disclaimer: For this project a fictional, randomly generated clinical trial was produced by AI software. The dataset is the ONLY thing in this analysis subjected to Artifical Intelligence creation or usage. The concepts of analysis, coding work and statistical methods used are entirely influenced by human thought and interpretation.*

## Background
Morava Respiratory Virus is a fictional, highly transmissible respiratory virus spread via droplets and close contact. Symptoms include: 
- Fever
- Persisten cough
- Fatigue
- Mild shortness of breath


Most cases are mild, but 15-20% develop moderate disease requiring outpatient oxygen therapy.

Viracure™ is a novel oral antiviral designed to inhibit MRV replication by targeting viral reverse RNA transcriptase activity.

## Study Design
This study is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial with a total of (N=) 240 participants. A random number generator was used to allocate particpant IDs to either Viracure or the placebo; each individual was assigned a number 1-1000 (to decrease duplicate chances) and then ascendingly sorted. The lowest 120 particpants were assigned Viracure treatment, while the greatest 120 particpants were assigned the placebo treatment.

The duration of the study was a 14-day, once a day oral tablet with a 28-day post-treatment follow up. The primary clinical endpoint analyzed will be time to symptom resolution with the secondary endpoints:
- Viral load reduction by Day 7
- Hospitalization rate
- Transmission to household contacts
- Adverse events
